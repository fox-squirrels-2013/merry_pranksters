Authenication links

Salted passwords? Something to check out for the future.

1)

Using a gem
http://phamlabs.com/2013/03/17/Adding-the-sinatra-authentication-Gem.html

Two types of users, admin and authenicated users

First user that logs in becomes admin user.

2)

Using someone else's coding suggestions (two options)
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3559824/what-is-a-very-simple-authentication-scheme-for-sinatra-rack

Two options here, one very very simple and one that is more persistant.

3)

OAuth as a solution (Users logging in via another API)
https://github.com/charliepark/omniauth-for-sinatra

Looks much more extensive and very interesting but probably well beyond the scope of this project... (for now...)
